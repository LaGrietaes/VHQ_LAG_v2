## üìù Notes

- The project structure is now complete and follows the master plan
- All core components are in place but need integration
- Focus should be on getting agents to communicate with real AI models
- n8n integration is the next major milestone
- Need to implement proper error handling and logging throughout
- Switched to pnpm for better performance and dependency management
